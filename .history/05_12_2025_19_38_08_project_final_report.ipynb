    "## KNN Classification Model\n",
    "This question requires a K-Nearest Neighbours Classification Model to predict if a observation will be subscribed or not. The predictors used will be the numeric variables, age and played hours. To create the best possible model we will use cross validation, split 75% into a training set and 25% into a testing set, with 10 folds. I chose 10 folds due to the realtivly small size of the dataset. Using more folds ensures the best k found is very reliabile and aplicable to data in general, not just the training set. After finding the best K, I used this on the unseen testing set, and found both the accuracy of the model as well as a confusion matrix of the results."

    "The KNN model shows its highest accuracy at around k = 6–9, reaching roughly 0.72–0.73 during cross-validation. This pattern indicates that small values of k tend to overfit, while large values underfit, flattening accuracy near 0.69. Even at its best, the model’s accuracy remains modest because the dataset is small and heavily imbalanced, with far more subscribed than non-subscribed players. The model performs noticeably better than random guessing, but the improvement is limited, suggesting that the predictors we used of age and hours played carry only weak-to-moderate signal for predicting subscription. This aligns with the exploratory analysis: hours played has some relationship to subscription, while age contributes little. Overall, the KNN results reinforce that engagement (hours played) matters more than demographics (age), but the available variables are not strong enough to build a highly reliable classifier."

    "Our exploratory analysis shows that hours played is the only predictor with a meaningful relationship to subscription behavior. The distribution of playtime is extremely right-skewed, with around 85 players recording zero hours, which pulls the mean downward and creates a large cluster at the lower bound. After applying a log scale to remove the masking effect of zero-hour players, we observe that subscribers are more likely to have played for longer periods, while non-subscribers remain concentrated near zero. This pattern indicates that engagement with the game is associated with a higher likelihood of subscribing.\n",

    "In contrast, age shows little to no relationship with the amount of time a player spends in the game. Players of different ages exhibit similar ranges of playtime, and the log-scaled scatterplot confirms that subscription trends do not vary systematically across age groups. This suggests that age is not a useful predictor of subscription and contributes limited information to the model.\n",

    "The K-Nearest Neighbours classifier reinforces these findings. After tuning k with cross-validation, the model achieved its best performance at k ≈ 6–9, reaching an accuracy of about 0.72–0.73 during validation and ~0.69 on the unseen test set. These results indicate that the predictors contain some signal but are not strong enough to produce highly accurate classifications. The modest performance reflects both the heavy imbalance in subscription outcomes and the limited predictive power of age. Overall, the analysis supports the conclusion that hours played is the dominant indicator of subscription, while age adds little value to the prediction task."

    "## Did Results Match Expectations?\n",
    "\n",
    "The results aligned closely with what we expected going into the analysis. Based on the structure of the dataset and the nature of game engagement, we anticipated that players who spend more time in the game would be more likely to subscribe, and the exploratory plots confirmed this relationship. We also expected age to contribute very little to the prediction task, since there was no theoretical reason to believe that older or younger players would inherently subscribe at different rates. The KNN model’s modest accuracy reinforces these expectations: it performs better than random guessing but cannot achieve high predictive power because the only informative predictor, hours played, captures engagement but not the broader motivations behind subscribing. Overall, the findings support our initial hypothesis that playtime would be the primary driver of subscription likelihood while age would have minimal impact."

    "## What Is the Impact of These Findings?\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings have practical implications for how the game company allocates its recruitment and marketing efforts. Since hours played is the only variable that meaningfully relates to subscription, the company should focus on behavior-based strategies rather than demographic ones. Targeting players who show early engagement, such as those who have played for at least a few hours, will likely be far more effective than campaigns aimed at specific age groups. The results also highlight a large segment of zero-hour players who never interact with the game at all, suggesting that resources should not be spent trying to convert this group until engagement barriers are addressed. At the same time, the modest accuracy of the KNN model indicates that predictive automation should be used cautiously; hours played alone cannot reliably identify all potential subscribers. In practice, this means the company can use playtime as a useful indicator of interest, but should combine it with additional behavioral signals or qualitative insights before making subscription-related decisions."

    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Several limitations limit the strength of our conclusions. The dataset is small, and the heavy skew caused by the large number of zero-hour players reduces the ability to detect subtle patterns in the data. The predictors of age and hours played capture only a narrow slice of player behavior, and the lack of additional features (such as session frequency, in-game actions, or prior engagement history) limits the model’s capacity to explain why players choose to subscribe. The strong imbalance between subscribed and non-subscribed players also biases the KNN classifier toward predicting the majority class, which reduces its usefulness in identifying unsubscribed players who might convert. Finally, distance-based models like KNN are sensitive to outliers and uneven scaling, making them less robust when predictors are skewed or contain many zeros. These constraints mean the results should be interpreted as preliminary rather than definitive."

    "## Future Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "Future work could strengthen these findings by incorporating additional behavioural variables and exploring alternative modeling approaches. More detailed measures of engagement, such as number of sessions, peak concurrent activity, or interaction with specific game features, would likely provide a richer basis for predicting subscription and help capture motivations that just playtime cannot. Addressing class imbalance through resampling techniques or weighted models could improve the classifier’s ability to detect unsubscribed players who might still be receptive to targeted outreach. Another potential improvement would be to collect more observations over time, especially tracking how engagement changes before or after players subscribe. This would allow for stronger causal insights and more reliable predictions."
